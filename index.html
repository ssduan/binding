                How do we choose from gold, clay, or crystal when making a goblet? Should we pay more attention to what should it do more than How should it look? As illustrated in The Crystal Goblet by Beatrice Ward in 1932, Typography should reveal the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain.

                    The design trend which impacts the looks of the goblets kept changing, as illustrated in two recent essays This is Auto-Tune Typography (2020) and  Knowing Your Design History is Crucial to Aesthetic Innovation (2022). Both essays propose critical perspectives for us to reexamine the use of style in Typography.
