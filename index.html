			<h1>On Styling the Goblet</h1>
		</header>

        <p>
            As illustrated in The Crystal Goblet by Beatrice Ward in 1932, Typography should reveal the beautiful thing which it was meant to contain. How we design the goblet to hold its content matters, as an overly stylized type shifts the focus away from ‘What should it do?’ To ‘How should it look?’.
        </p>
        <p>
            All three essays compiled here discussed the relationship between content and style in Typography. The design trend which impacts the looks of the goblets kept changing, as illustrated in two recent essays “This is Auto-Tune Typography (2020)” and “Knowing Your Design History is Crucial to Aesthetic Innovation (2022)”. However, they both propose a critical perspective in adopting a trend for in the end, for it is for the content to decide whether its vessel should be made from gold, clay, or crystal.
